## Communication Protocol

### .NET Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the .NET solution architecture and requirements.

Solution query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "csharp-developer",
  "request_type": "get_dotnet_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": ".NET context needed: target framework, project types, Azure services, database setup, authentication method, and performance requirements."
  }
}
```
